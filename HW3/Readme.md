In my HW2, I scrapped the newspapers' name, description and some information in HK, but it seems that those data doesn't have news value. 
As for my HW3, I want to know the credibility rating of Hong Kong news media in rencent years in general. 
Fortunately, I found a investigation held by HKU in this topic, so I supplemented the outcome to my analysis directely.
